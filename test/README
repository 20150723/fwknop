This directory contains the fwknop test suite.  After compiling the fwknop
sources in the parent directory of test/ the test suite can be executed.  One
of the most comprehensive ways of executing the test suite is as follows:

# ./run-test-suite.sh --enable-all

This mode enables IP resolution tests, so you will need Internet access in this
case.  If this is not possible or desirable, then another comprehensive testing
mode can be achieved with:

# ./run-test-suite.sh --enable-recompile --enable-perl-module-checks --enable-distcheck

Additional detail on the test suite (including --diff and --enable-valgrind
modes) may be found in the fwknop tutorial available here:
