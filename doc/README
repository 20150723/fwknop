NOTES on the generation of the fwknop man pages:

UNtil we decide on a better way, the man pages for 'fwknop' (client) and
'fwknopd' (server) are generated from the asciidoc sources in this directory,
then copied to their respective directories before check-in.

We use the "a2x" command to generate the inital nroff-formated version,
which is then manually edited to clean it up a bit.  The "a2x" command is:

    a2x -f manpage  fwknopd.man.asciidoc

This creates the "fwknopd.8" man page.  However, depending on the a2x and.or
asciidoc configuration on your system, you may have to edit the "fwknopd.8"
file directly to remove the "[FIXME: source/manual]" string embedded within.
At present, we simply remove them.  There may also be places where you want
items on succesive line without intervening lines (i.e. the AUTHORS section
of the generated man page).  In those cases, simply change the ".sp"
between those lines to ".br".
