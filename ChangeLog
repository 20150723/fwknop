	* Added the ability to send SPA packets over valid HTTP requests with
      the fwknop-c client.
	* Added support for transmitting SPA packets over IPv6 via TCP and UDP
      sockets, and also via HTTP.
	* Added GnuPG 'hQ' base64 encoded prefix handling (this prefix is
      stripped out of encrypted SPA packet data).
	* Added hostname resolution support to the fwknop-c client if the SPA
      server is specified as a hostname instead of an IP address.
