fwknop-2.0.1 (07//2012):
    - Bug fix where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in
      the access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the
      second stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been
      fixed for the fwknop-2.0.1 release, and was reported by Andy Rowland. Now
      the fwknopd server computes the SHA256 digest of raw incoming payload
      data before decryption, and compares this against all previous hashes.
      Previous to this commit, fwknopd would add a new hash to the replay
      digest list right after the first access.conf stanza match, so when SPA
      packet data matched the second access.conf stanza a matching replay
      digest would already be there.
    - Bug fix for PF firewalls: updated the PF anchor check to not rely on
      listing the PF policy - use 'pfctl -s Anchor' instead.
    - [test suite] Added parsing of valgrind output to produce a listing of
      functions that have been flagged - this assists in the development
      process to ensure that fwknop is not leaking memory.
    - Minor gcc warning fix: fko_decode.c:43:17: warning: variable ‘edata_size’
      set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable].

fwknop-2.0 (01/02/2012):
    - This is the first production release that has been completely re-written
      in C.  This brings Single Packet Authorization functionality to all sorts
      of machines from embedded devices to large systems.  iptables, ipfw, and
      pf firewalls are supported by the fwknopd daemon, and the fwknop client
      is known to work on most major *NIX environments, the iPhone and Android
      operating systems, and Cygwin under Windows.
    - Added FORCE_NAT mode to the access.conf file so that for any valid SPA
      packet, force the requested connection to be NAT'd through to the
      specified (usually internal) IP and port value.  This is useful if there
      are multiple internal systems running a service such as SSHD, and you
      want to give transparent access to only one internal system for each
      stanza in the access.conf file.  This way, multiple external users can
      each directly access only one internal system per SPA key.
    - Added two new access.conf variables are added "ACCESS_EXPIRE" and
      "ACCESS_EXPIRE_EPOCH" to allow access stanzas to be expired without
      having to modify the access.conf file and restart fwknopd.
    - Added a new feature to allow an access stanza that matches the SPA source
      address to not automatically short circuit other stanzas if there is an
      error (such as when there are multiple encryption keys involved and an
      incoming SPA packet is meant for, say, the second stanza and the first
      therefore doesn't allow proper decryption).
    - Bug fix to exclude SPA packets with timestamps in the future that are too
      great (old packets were properly excluded already).
    - Bug fix to honor the fwknop client --time-offset-plus and
      --time-offset-minus options
    - Added DNAT mode tests, minor memory leak fix in NAT mode, added fwknopd
      check for ENABLE_IPT_FORWARDING variable before attempting NAT access.
    - [test suite] Added --diff mode to compare results from one execution to
      the next.
