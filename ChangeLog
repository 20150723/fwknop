    * Implemented -s command line argument on the fwknop client command line
      so that the IP "0.0.0.0" can be sent within an SPA packet.  The fwknopd
      server can wrap access requirements around this IP.
    * Initial public release of fwknop-c-0.62.

2009-07-23  Michael Rash  <mbr@cipherdyne.org>
    * Added the --show-last and --no-save command line options to show the
      command line used for the previous fwknop invocation, and to have the
      fwknop client not save its command line arguments.
    * Bug fix to force libfko to recalculate the random data embedded in the
      the SPA packet after a random port is acquired via --rand-port or
      --nat-rand-port.  This is a precaution so that an attacker cannot guess
      some of the internal SPA data based on the destination port number.

    * Got forward and local NAT modes working with the --nat-access,
      --nat-local, --nat-port, and --nat-randport options.  All NAT modes
      are now passing the fwknop test suite.
    * Added the --server-command option to build an SPA packet with a command
      for the server to execute.
    * Added the --fw-timeout option for client side timeouts to be specified.
    * Added the --time-offset-plus and --time-offset-minus options to allow
      the user to influence the timestamp associated with an SPA packet.
    * Added the --rand-port option so that the SPA packet destination port can
      be randomized.

2009-07-16  Michael Rash  <mbr@cipherdyne.org>
    * Added the ability to send SPA packets over valid HTTP requests with
      the fwknop-c client.
    * Added support for transmitting SPA packets over IPv6 via TCP and UDP
      sockets, and also via HTTP.
    * Added GnuPG 'hQ' base64 encoded prefix handling (this prefix is
      stripped out of encrypted SPA packet data).
    * Added hostname resolution support to the fwknop-c client if the SPA
      server is specified as a hostname instead of an IP address.
