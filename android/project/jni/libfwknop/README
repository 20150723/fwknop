README for the libfwknop directory (android/project/jni/libfwknop)
===============================================================================

This directory should contain all of the .c and .h files from the fwknop
main distribution "lib" directory. These are the source files for libfko.
You can either copy or link to the libfko source files.  Either way, they
need to exist in this directory before you attempt to build the Android
fwknop client.
