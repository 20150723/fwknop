To whom it may concern, this is -*- outline -*- mode.

* The library - libfko:
** C-based test suite.
** Get it out there and get feedback.

* The fwknop C client:
** Config file support.
** Command-line options and features ala fwknop Perl client:
*** Add NAT support.
*** Server Command support.
*** Server Auth support (maybe). 
*** Client timeout support.
*** Last command support (and show last command).
*** Time offset from command line
*** Rand port and NAT rand port.
*** Add Resolve External IP (-R), --source-ip (-s), and --URL functionality.
** Man page

* The fwknopd server:
** Sniffer support to acquire SPA packet data ala the fwknopd Perl server:
*** Packets acquired via libpcap from a live networking interface.
*** Packets acquired via a file (supports the ulogd pcap writer).
*** User-defined pcap filters.
*** IP address exclusions/inclusions.
** Replay attack detection via storage and verification of SPA digests.
** SPA packet decryption:
*** Support of multiple encryption keys and access requirements (SOURCE stanzas).
*** GnuPG and Rijndael decryption.
*** Username restrictions.
** Firewall rule manipulation upon receipt of a valid SPA packet:
*** Initially manipulate firewall rules by executing the firewall binary directly.
*** Possibly use libdnet once we move past executing the firewall binary.
*** Should concentrate on iptables, but ipfw and pf support eventually.
*** User-defined firewall rule timeouts.
*** NAT rules to internal systems.
** Test on embedded platforms - especially OpenWRT on a Linksys router.
** Process monitoring daemon (can probably just use knopwatchd since it is C already).

* Nice to haves:
** Binary packages:
*** Redhat RPMS
*** Debian .deb
*** Solaris pkg
** Linux/Unix platform:
*** A GNOME or KDE GUI app for the client.
** Windows platform:
*** VB and/or C# class wrappers around libfko.dll.
*** A Windows GUI app that uses the dll or wrapper classes.
** Misc:
*** Python module wrapping libfko.
*** Ruby module wrapping libfko.
*** PHP module wrapping libfko.
