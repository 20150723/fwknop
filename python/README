fko python module version 1.0
==============================

This module is essentially a Python wrapper for the Firewall Knock
Operator library, "libfko".  See the "libfko" documentation for
additional information on the functionality provided by "libfko"
and usage overview.

Before attempting to build this module, libfko needs to be installed on
the system.

To build and install the module:

   * Build with "python setup.py build"
   * Install with "python setup.py install"

Note: This version is just a plain wrapper around libfko.  I do plan to
      make a more complete OO Python module that wraps this one. --DSS
