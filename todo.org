** COMPLETED
   This bucket is for completed tasks.
*** Update fwknopd man page for GPG_ALLOW_NO_PW
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-14 Tue>
*** Preserve existing configs under 'make install'
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-13 Mon>
    - The current 'make install' behavior overwrites any existing fwknopd config
    files from a previous installation.
    - Updated to install fwknopd.conf -> /etc/fwknop/fwknopd.conf.inst if the
      fwknopd.conf file already exists, and similarly for the access.conf
      file.
*** fwknopd iptables comment match detection
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-12 Sun>
   Hank Leininger suggested that fwknopd do better detection for the iptables
   comment match since it is required for the expiration of SPA rules.
*** Set restrictive permissions on /etc/fwknop/ directory and /etc/fwknop/* files
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-12 Sun>
    Current default permissions on /etc/fwknop/ and /etc/fwknop/* are too lax.
** Update fwknopd man page to include IPFW* vars
   None of the ipfw variables are currently documented in the fwknopd man
   page.
** Use assert() in various places
   Use assert() to validate expected values wherever possible.
** [server] For Ubuntu systems, have fwknopd managed by upstart
   fwknopd can benefit from upstart management and monitoring on Ubuntu
   systems.
** [server] Include files for access.conf
   Hank Leininger suggested that the main access.conf file have an option to
   include other files in which access stanzas can be specified.  This makes
   it easy to wrap additional controls around access information particularly
   in multi-user environments.
** [test suite] Remove lib check for test suite when running in --enable-recompile mode
   When creating a release tarball under 'make dist', the test suite performs
   a check for existing lib/ directory even under --enable-recompile.
** [server] ipfw active/expire sets cannot be the same
   Add a check to ensure that active and expire sets are not the same value in
   fwknopd.conf, and add a corresponding test in the test suite.
** [test suite] SPA packet fuzzer
   Add a series of patches to the fwknop client that break how it produces SPA
   data in subtle ways in order to ensure proper validation by fwknopd.
** [test suite] backwards compatibility tests
   The test suite should have the ability to test backwards compatibility
   between fwknop versions.
