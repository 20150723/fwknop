*** fwknopd iptables comment match detection
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-12 Sun>
   Hank Leininger suggested that fwknopd do better detection for the iptables
   comment match since it is required for the expiration of SPA rules.
*** Set restrictive permissions on /etc/fwknop/ directory and /etc/fwknop/* files.
    :CLOSED: <2012-08-12 Sun>
    Current default permissions on /etc/fwknop/ and /etc/fwknop/* are too lax.
** Include files for access.conf
   Hank Leininger suggested that the main access.conf file have an option to
   include other files in which access stanzas can be specified.  This makes
   it easy to wrap additional controls around access information particularly
   in multi-user environments.
** Remove lib check for test suite when running in --enable-recompile mode
   When creating a release tarball under 'make dist', the test suite performs
   a check for existing lib/ directory even under --enable-recompile.
** ipfw active/expire sets cannot be the same
   Add a check to ensure that active and expire sets are not the same value in
   fwknopd.conf, and add a corresponding test in the test suite.
