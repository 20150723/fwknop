* fwknop tasks
  This is the main todo org mode file for the fwknop project
** fwknopd iptables comment match detection
   Hank Leininger suggested that fwknopd do better detection for the iptables
   comment match since it is required for the expiration of SPA rules.
** Include files for access.conf
   Hank Leininger suggested that the main access.conf file have an option to
   include other files in which access stanzas can be specified.  This makes
   it easy to wrap additional controls around access information particularly
   in multi-user environments.
