Ozmart
    - Suggested the idea for setting an access stanza expiration time.
    - Suggested the abiliy to have certain incoming connections automatically

Ted Wynnychenko
    - Helped test fwknop PF support on OpenBSD.

Andy Rowland
    - Reported a bug where the same encryption key used for two stanzas in the
      access.conf file would result in access requests that matched the second
      stanza to always be treated as a replay attack.  This has been fixed for
      the fwknop-2.0.1 release.

C Anthony Risinger
    - Caught a bug where the default PCAP_LOOP_SLEEP value was 1/100th of a
      second instead of the intended default of 1/10th of a second.

    - Contributed a new Debian init script.
