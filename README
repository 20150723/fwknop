This is the top-level directory for the C version of fwknop.

Additionl information and details can be found on the fwknop-c site at
http://devmetrix.org/trac/fwknop-c.

libfwnop source files:
======================
These will be compiled into libfwknop.a (static for now).

spa_random_number.c     - Generate a string of 16 random hex digits.
spa_user.c              - Get or spoof the current user.
spa_timestamp.c         - Get the current timestamp with optional offset.
spa_version.c           - Get the fwknop-client version number.
spa_message_type.c      - Set the message type.
spa_message.c           - Construct the raw spa message based on the current
                          spa data.
spa_nat_access.c        - <not implemented yet>
spa_server_auth.c       - <not implemented yet>
spa_client_timeout.c    - <not implemented yet>
spa_digest.c            - Constructs the message digest based on the current
                          spa message data.

md5.c                   - Generates md5.  Can return raw, hex, or base64.
sha1.c                  - Generates md5.  Can return raw, hex, or base64.
sha256.c                - Generates md5.  Can return raw, hex, or base64.
digest.c                - Provide front-end hooks to the digest fuctions.

rijndael.c              - The base Rihndael code.
cipher_funcs.c          - Provides the code hooks to encrypt/decrypt using
                          rijndael that is compatible with the Perl
                          Crypt::CBC module (using Rijndael).

fwknop.h                - The main common header file.  It contain default
                          definitions, and protypes for the spa_xxx functions.

Executables:
============

fwknop                  - Soon to be the fwknop client.  At present, it just
                          dumps some internal data for functional verification
                          during development.

fko_test                - A temp program for testing libfwknop functions during
                          during development.  This will go away once we have
                          a fair amount of progress in developing the client
                          (and maybe the server).
