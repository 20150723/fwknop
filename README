This is the top-level directory for the C version of fwknop.

Additional information and details can be found on the fwknop-c site at
http://devmetrix.org/trac/fwknop-c.


INTRODUCTION
============
This distribution will be a C-based implementation of Michael Rash's
Perl-based "fwkop" programs.  For more information on fwknop and what
it is all about, go to http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop.


CURRENT STATE
=============
At present, we have an initial implementation of the Firewall Knock
Operator library; `libfko'.  This library provides the back-end functionality
for managing the Single Packet Authorization (SPA) data that fwknop
employs.

This first version is planned to be compatible with fwknop version 1.9.x.


BUILDING libfko
===============
This distribution uses GNU autoconf for setting up the build.  Please see
the `INSTALL' file for details.


NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS
===================
If you are pulling this distribution from Subversion, you will need to
run the "autogen.sh" script in the top of the distribution directory in '
order to generate the autoconf (and other) meta files, and the `configure'
script.
