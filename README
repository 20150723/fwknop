Executables:
============

fwknop                  - Soon to be the fwknop client.  At present, it just
                          dumps some internal data for functional verification
                          during development.

fko_test                - A temp program for testing libfwknop functions during
                          during development.  This will go away once we have
                          a fair amount of progress in developing the client
                          (and maybe the server).
