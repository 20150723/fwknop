This is the top-level directory for the C version of fwknop.

Additional information and details can be found on the fwknop-c site at
http://devmetrix.org/trac/fwknop-c.


INTRODUCTION
============
This distribution will be a C-based implementation of Michael Rash's
Perl-based "fwknop" programs.  For more information on fwknop and what
it is all about, go to http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop.


CURRENT STATE
=============
At present, we have an initial implementation of the Firewall Knock
Operator library; `libfko'.  This library provides the back-end functionality
for managing the Single Packet Authorization (SPA) data that fwknop
employs.

This first version is planned to be compatible with fwknop version 1.9.x.


BUILDING libfko
===============
This distribution uses GNU autoconf for setting up the build.  Please see
the `INSTALL' file for the general basics on using autoconf.

There are some "configure" options that are specific to fwknop.  They are
(extracted from ./configure --help):

  --with-gpgme            support for gpg encryption using libgpgme
                          [default=check]
  --with-gpgme-prefix=PFX prefix where GPGME is installed (optional)
  --with-gpg=/path/to/gpg Specify path to the gpg executable that gpgme will
                          use [default=check path]
  --with-iptables=/path/to/iptables
                          Specify path to the iptables executable
                          [default=check path]
  --with-ipfw=/path/to/ipfw
                          Specify path to the ipfw executable [default=check
                          path]
  --with-sh=/path/to/sh   Specify path to the sh executable [default=check
                          path]


NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS
===================
If you are pulling this distribution from Subversion, you will need to
run the "autogen.sh" script in the top of the distribution directory in '
order to generate the autoconf (and other) meta files, and the `configure'
script.

The fwknop and fwknopd man page nroff sources are included in their
respective directorys (client and server).  These nroff files are derived
from the asciidoc sources in the 'docs' directory.  See the README in docs
for details.
